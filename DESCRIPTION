Description: A supra-hexagonal map is a giant hexagon on a 2-dimensional grid seamlessly consisting of smaller hexagons. It is supposed to train, analyse and visualise a high-dimensional omics input data. The supraHex is able to carray out gene clustering/meta-clustering and sample correlation, plus intuitive visualisations to facilitate exploratory analysis. More importantly, it allows for overlaying additional data to explore relations between input and additional data. Uniquely to this package, users can ultrafastly understand any tabular omics data, both scientifically and artistically, especially in a sample-specific fashion but without loss of information on large genes.
